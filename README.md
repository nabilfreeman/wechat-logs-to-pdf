# wechat-logs-to-pdf
Extract chat logs from a WeChat iOS SQLite database and display them in a pretty way

# Introduction

I wrote this for my wife's visa application to show proof of relationship to the UK government. I thought 5 years of WeChat logs would be pretty funny to send so I made a script to export them all to PDF, then printed about 500 pages and posted it to the Home Office.

We got the visa. ðŸŽ‰

I haven't tested this for years, but there is a good chance this will still work. Do a USB backup of your iPhone on a Mac, and try `npm start`. The prompts will help you identify where WeChat is in the backup.

# Support

If you run into problems, open an issue and @ me. I can't promise anything as I'm very busy these days, but I have a feeling anybody trying to do this has a pretty important reason so I'll try and help you.
